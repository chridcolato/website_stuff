			<p>This is my little avatar, I enjoy creating concepts, editing, and seeing how the final project turns out. I take a lot of my inspirations from cartoons and media that I've consumed as a kid, the medium that I believe I excel the most in 2-D art and logo design. I hope you enjoy my work! Make sure to click on the other 2 options on the top to see my work and get in contact with me.</p>
