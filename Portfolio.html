			<h2>Short Film: Don't Cry...Just Buy!</h2>
			<p><video width="300" controls><source src="media/Colato_Christopher_FINALVIDEO.mp4"></video></p>
			<p>I present to you my short film! The idea for this project came to me almost immediately, with almost all filming for it being done in one go. A lot of the editing was also fun, with the fire effect on the wallet and the scream from it being my favorite part of the whole project. Overall, the video is about an intern trying to make a commercial for the company Pokémon, but after finding someone to interview, things get a little weird...I hope you enjoy!!</p>

			<h2>Short Film</h2>
			<p><video width="300" controls><source src="media/Stopmotion.mp4"></video></p>
			<p>This is my stop-motion project! I enjoyed the process of making it the most, as it took a lot of pateince to get to the final product. The lighting was a big thing for me as I didn't want it too dim but not bright as well. I wanted the project to feel chaotically cozy and I hope that was properly conveyed in the project itself. It's about two friends having a conversation when another person joins, but no one can understand them. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

			<h2>Poster: Don't Cry...Just Buy!</h2>
			<p><img src="media/imaging.png" width="300" class="social"></p>
			<p>Last, but not least, my poster project that ties into my short film. I wanted to play with the idea that the character from the short film was stuck in his never-ending quest to buy more Pokémon products, so with that being said, I used a lot of Pokémon cards and created a layer for each section to give it that illusion of depth. In addition to that, I added a shadow to both the title and the character in the middle to emphasize that feeling. I hope you like it!</p>
